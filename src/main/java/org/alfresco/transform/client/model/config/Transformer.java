/**
 * Represents a set of transformations supported by the Transform Service or Local Transform Service Registry that
 * share the same transform options. Each may be an actual transformer or a pipeline of multiple transformers. It is
 * possible that more than one transformer may able to perform a transformation from one mimetype to another. The actual
 * selection of transformer is up to the Transform Service or Local Transform Service Registry to decide. Clients may
 * use {@link TransformServiceRegistry#isSupported(String, long, String, java.util.Map, String)} to decide
 * if they should send a request to the Transform Service. As a result clients have a simple generic view of
 * transformations which allows new transformations to be added without the need to change client data structures other
 * than to define new name value pairs. For this to work the Transform Service defines unique names for each option.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>transformerName - is optional but if supplied should be unique. The client should infer nothing from the name
 *     as it is simply a label, but the Local Transform Service Registry will use the name in pipelines.</lI>
 *     <li>transformOptions - a grouping of individual transformer transformOptions. The group may be optional and may
 *     contain nested transformOptions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For local transforms, this structure is extended when defining a pipeline transform.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>transformerPipeline - an array of pairs of transformer name and target extension for each transformer in the
 *     pipeline. The last one should not have an extension as that is defined by the request and should be in the
 *     supported list.</li>
 * </ul>
